/// Every string a person reads, looked up by key in the language they chose.
///
/// **Why this is not `.strings` / `.xcstrings` / `String(localized:)`.** Three constraints, all of
/// them already load-bearing elsewhere in the project:
///
/// - Pane builds with the Command Line Tools alone (no Xcode project, see `Package.swift`), and
///   `.xcstrings` catalogs are compiled by Xcode.
/// - The language is switchable *inside the app*, live, without a relaunch. Apple's lookup follows
///   the process's language and is cached for its lifetime.
/// - A third of the product's strings live in the web editor, which Foundation cannot reach. The
///   catalog has to be a plain file both sides read, or the two halves drift.
///
/// So the catalogs are plain JSON, one directory per language under `Locales/`:
///
///     Locales/en/strings.json      flat `"key": "text"` pairs, `{name}` placeholders
///     Locales/en/welcome.md        the first note a new vault gets
///
/// **Adding a language is adding a directory** — copy `en/`, translate, done. Nothing in the code
/// names a language: the list is discovered, the picker in Settings is built from it, the web
/// bundle reads the same files at build time, and `build-app.sh` declares each one in `Info.plist`.
/// `Locales/README.md` is the contributor's version of this paragraph.
///
