/// `vaultPath` is a setting, and a setting lives in the file both builds read, so pointing the debug
/// build at a scratch vault silently repointed the daily one too. Decision 30's own hazard — a vault
/// re-pointed at an empty folder is indistinguishable from a vault that got destroyed — reached from
/// the one direction nobody was watching, because it is a development path rather than a user one.
///
/// So a scratch build gets its own everything. It is not a mode the app switches into at runtime;
/// its identity is stamped into `Info.plist` by `Scripts/build-app.sh --debug` (or `--dev`) and read
/// once, so inherited environment and stale settings cannot change its channel.

/// "test against a scratch vault, never the real one — synthetic input into a pane that is showing a
/// real note will edit that note, and did once." A rule that depends on remembering to repoint a
/// shared file is a rule that gets forgotten on the session where it matters.
