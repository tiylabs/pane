/// Design frame 3c — the Shortcuts tab.
///
/// A plain table, which is the design's own point: every future feature adds a row, never a new
/// control style. Every row is a binding the web layer installs inside a pane.
///
/// **This tab answers "what would you want to change", not "what keys exist".** Conflating the two
/// took it to sixteen rows in one column, three of which nobody would ever touch: the summon hotkey
/// was here *and* on General — the same recorder twice — and ⌘F and ⌥⌘F mean find and replace in
/// every editor anyone has used. The line now lives in `Settings.fixedShortcuts`, which carries the
/// reasoning; what matters here is that a key being absent from this tab does not make it absent
/// from the app. Each one still prints itself in ⌘K or in the control's own tooltip, and every one
/// of those reads the binding in force rather than a literal.
///
/// The summon hotkey is deliberately **not** here any more. It is the one Carbon binding (decision
/// 9) and the one key that has to work while Pane is not frontmost, so it keeps its recorder — on
/// General, where it always also was.
///
/// The count is `Settings.shortcutActions.count`; don't restate it here without changing it there.
/// `NSTabViewController` gives each tab its own height, so shrinking this one does not disturb the
/// others.
///
/// The rule that governs this list has not moved: a recordable row that binds nothing is a worse lie
/// than an absent row, so a row appears here only when `Settings.shortcutActions` has an entry doing
/// something. Recently Deleted is the one ⌘K row with no entry, because the design gives it no
/// shortcut and a blank waiting to be filled in is the same lie in a different shape.
