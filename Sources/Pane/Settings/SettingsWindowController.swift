/// Design frames 2c and 3a–3c — Settings, as a real window.
///
/// Decision 16: **a real window, not a pane.** Standard macOS chrome, toolbar tabs, ⌘W to close, and
/// the one thing in Pane that is allowed to activate the app. That is the point rather than a
/// concession — settings change rarely, and putting them in a pane would cost the pane chrome it has
/// to carry every second of every day for a window opened twice a year.
///
/// `NSTabViewController` in `.toolbar` style is the frame's chrome exactly: icon above label. Written
/// out by hand it would be a toolbar delegate, a tab view and a pile of size animations; the platform
/// already has all three and gets them right.
///
/// The one thing taken off it is per-tab sizing — see `preferredContentSize` below. The window is one
/// size, and the tab that does not fit scrolls.

        // tallest of the rest, so switching to it threw the window open and switching away snapped
        // it shut, with the tab bar moving under the pointer as you read it. About was the same
