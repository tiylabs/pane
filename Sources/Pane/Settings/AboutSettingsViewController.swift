/// The About tab — what you are running, and whether it is the latest.
///
/// Not in the design record: frames 2c and 3a–3c draw four tabs and this is a fifth. It is here
/// because the app had no route to its own version at all, which for an unsigned build distributed
/// as a zip and a cask is a real gap: "which one am I on" had no answer inside the app.
///
/// **This button is one of the two callers of Pane's only network call.** Decision 7 says no server,
/// no account, no protocol, and telemetry is on the not-doing list; a version check is none of
/// those, and nothing is sent but the request itself. Decision 9 is untouched: an outgoing HTTPS
/// request needs no entitlement and no privacy permission, so `Info.plist` gains nothing.
///
/// **Amended: "only when this button is pressed" is no longer true.** The same request is made on
/// summon, about once a day, so that somebody on an old build finds out — see decision 136 and
/// `UpdateChecker`. Nothing fires on *launch* and nothing is on a *timer*, which is the half of 94
/// that survives: both callers are a press or a keypress, so the request only happens with a person
/// at the keyboard. This button remains the way to ask on purpose, and it works with the setting
/// switched off, because pressing it is asking.
///
/// It also does not download, install, or open anything. Pane is unsigned (decision 9), so an
/// auto-updater would need a signing story the project does not have — and the install path is a
/// Homebrew cask, which already knows how to upgrade. The button's whole job is to answer the
/// question; `brew upgrade --cask pane` or the Releases link does the rest.
