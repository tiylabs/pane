/// This narrows decision 2 rather than reversing it. Decision 2 exists so that a vault's names do
/// not churn *during sync* — a rename can reach iCloud Drive or Syncthing as a delete plus a create,
/// which is the largest single generator of duplicate copies. Every rename this file decides on
/// happens inside the first minutes of a note's life, while the note is on screen and before the
/// provider has done much with it. The alternative, measured in the real vault, is worse: 8 of the
/// 12 notes in it carried a filename that disagreed with their title, because decision 2 froze the
/// name at the first 500 ms typing pause and a note titled while thinking got named after the
/// thought.
///
/// **The timestamp never changes.** It is the creation time, and that is decision 2's real content —
/// only the slug moves.
///
/// Pure, and separate from the code that moves files, because the interesting part is the decision
/// and the decision is the part with edge cases.
