/// has already launched something.
///
/// And notes *do* contain them. Every other `NSWorkspace.open` in Plume names a URL Plume itself
/// built — the releases page, the themes folder, a file in the vault. This one opens a string a
/// person pasted, which makes it the first place where the **note** chooses what the app launches.
/// Measured on this machine: `file:///etc/passwd` resolves to TextEdit, `x-apple-reminderkit://`
/// to Reminders, `ftp://` to Finder. None of those is a link anybody meant to follow.
///
