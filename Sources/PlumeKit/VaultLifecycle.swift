/// with the fold treated as part of the design: at 460 the note is 924pt and the panel shows ~370 of
/// it, so everything load-bearing — all four keys and the ⇧⌘/ tip — is on the first screen, and the
/// cut lands on an unticked checkbox, which is a more specific invitation to scroll than a sentence
/// severed mid-clause. **⌘K is named**, which the first version never did despite it carrying
/// fifteen actions. **The vault path is not named**: `~/Documents/Plume` is true only until someone
/// moves their vault, after which the note is a lie sitting in their own folder — "a folder you own"

        This is a note. Press **⌃⌥Space** to put Plume away. Press it again and Plume comes right back.

        ## Start with three keys

        - **⌘N** New note
        - **⌘P** Find a note
        - **⌘K** Everything else

        Plume starts at a fixed size. Press **⇧⌘/** if you'd rather have it grow with your notes.

        ## Just write

        Markdown formats as you type.

        Try **bold**, *italic*, `code`, a heading, a list, or a checkbox.

        - [ ] Tick this box
        - [x] This one's done

        The markdown for the line you're editing stays visible, so you can always see what you're \
        writing.

        > Every note is a plain `.md` file in a folder you own. No database. No account. Nothing to \
        sign into.

        You can find them anytime with **⌘K → Reveal in Finder**.

        That's enough to get started.

        Feel free to delete this note. Plume won't bring it back.
