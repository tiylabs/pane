# the bundle, and signs it — with a Developer ID when PLUME_SIGN_IDENTITY is set (the release
# workflow), ad-hoc otherwise (arm64 binaries must carry at least an ad-hoc signature to launch, and
# rewriting the bundle invalidates the signature SwiftPM applied).

#   Scripts/build-app.sh --debug         isolated Plume Dev.app, faster, for iterating
#   Scripts/build-app.sh --dev --release isolated Plume Dev.app with release optimization
#   Scripts/build-app.sh --universal     arm64 + x86_64, for a release artifact
