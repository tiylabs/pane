// swift-tools-version:6.0
import PackageDescription

// Plume is built with SwiftPM rather than an Xcode project: the app is a single executable plus a
// web bundle, and `swift build` works with only the Command Line Tools installed. `Scripts/build-app.sh`
// assembles the .app around the binary.
//
// The split is deliberate. PlumeKit holds everything that is pure Foundation — filenames, hashing,
// the write model, the vault watcher, state persistence, geometry arithmetic, switcher ordering — so
// it can be unit-tested without a window server. Plume holds only what genuinely needs AppKit, WebKit
// or Carbon.
