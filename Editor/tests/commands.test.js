/*
 * The formatting commands, every one against every shape of selection.
 *
 * This exists because the commands produced a stream of bugs that could only be found by using the
 * app — bold spanning a blank line, a list marker on a blank line, `==` written across a soft break
 * where it can never render, ⌘L never moved onto the block primitive at all. Each was reported,
 * fixed, and followed by another, because "did I finish the migration?" had no answer.
 *
 * It has one now. Eleven commands × five selection shapes, asserting the **bytes** each writes and
 * whether pressing it twice returns the note to exactly what it was. Decision 5 says what lands on
 * disk is what was typed, so bytes are the only assertion worth making here.
 *
 * Run with `Scripts/test-editor.sh`. Runs in a real WKWebView against the real parser, because the
 * browser harness cannot measure layout and a mocked tree would not catch the bugs this is for.

 *
