/*
 * The bubble that names a control, and *when* it appears.
 *
 * On the same `editor-probe` as the other suites, and here for the reason decision 113 gives: this
 * is chrome behaviour that only exists on screen. But the question is time rather than geometry, so
 * every case waits out a real timer — which is why `run` is async and why the probe awaits it.
 *
 * The fault it was written for: the bubble appeared the instant the pointer touched a control, so
 * crossing the title bar on the way to the text produced three of them, none of them asked for.
