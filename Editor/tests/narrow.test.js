/**
 * The ⌘K panel at a panel width nobody designed the labels for.
 *
 * Run at **380**, which is inside the band this rule exists for: below 420 the shortcut chips go,
 * and 380 is far enough in that a stray pixel of rounding cannot decide the result. The suite that
 * measures the overlays at rest runs at 460 and cannot see any of this — the probe's window is one
 * width, and until this file it was hardwired to 460.
 *
 * What is asserted is the thing that was reported: **a row you cannot read**. Six of fifteen labels
 * truncated at the old minimum — `Enable Win…`, `Copy as Ma…`, `Keep on Thi…` — which is a panel
 * that cannot answer the only question it exists to answer. So the assertions are `scrollWidth`
 * against `clientWidth` per row, not the presence of a CSS rule: a rule that is present and losing
 * to something else is exactly how this project's faults look (decision 71, four times over).
