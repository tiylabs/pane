 * The ⌘P switcher's geometry: what the arrow keys actually put on screen.
 *
 * The third suite driven by `Scripts/editor-probe.swift`, and it exists for the same reason the
 * markdown suite does — the bug it was written for is invisible to anything that only reads the DOM.
 * The rows were right, the selection was right, the scroll offset was right, and the list still
 * looked broken, because a `position: absolute` overlay inside a scroll container scrolls with the
 * content: the bottom fade rode up into the middle of the list and washed out whichever row it
 * landed on. Nothing short of measuring painted boxes catches that.
 *
 * So every assertion here is a rectangle, compared against the rectangle of the thing that must not
 * cover it.
 *
 * ⌘K is measured here too rather than in a file of its own. The two panels are one component in two
 * modes (decision 46), they are placed by one calculation and now capped by one token, and the way
 * that arrangement breaks is a row of one of them ending up somewhere no key can reach.
