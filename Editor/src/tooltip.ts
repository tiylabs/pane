 * The little bubble that names a control, and the shortcut for it.
 *
 * One implementation for every button in the panel — title bar, footer, format bar. It started in the
 * format bar (decision 58) and stayed there for one build, which immediately read as two vocabularies
 * in one window: the format bar answered instantly in the panel's own material while the icons six
 * inches above it waited a second and answered in the system's yellow.
 *
 * One element for the whole panel rather than one per button: it is only ever showing one thing, and a
 * dozen hidden divs is a dozen things to keep positioned. Absolutely positioned, out of the flow —
 * the title bar's and footer's heights feed `reportContentHeight`, so a bubble that took part in
 * layout would resize the window every time the pointer crossed a button (decision 41).

/*
 * How long the pointer has to rest on a control before it is named.
 *
 * Instant was the first behaviour and it reads as noise: the bubble fired on every pass of the
 * cursor, so crossing the title bar on the way to the text produced three of them and none of them
 * had been asked for. A pause is the whole signal — it is the difference between the pointer being
 * *somewhere* and the reader wanting to know what that something is.
 *
 * 800ms, and **every** hover pays it. A warm window was built first — show one bubble and the next
 * control is instant, which is what AppKit, Windows and Qt all do, and the argument for it is that a
 * row of icons should not cost a wait each. It was reported as a bug within minutes of shipping,
 * and the report was right about the thing that matters: with it, moving from ⌘P to ⌘K was
 * indistinguishable from having no delay at all, so the feature could not be felt in the place
 * people actually look at chrome — one control after another along a row. A delay you cannot
 * perceive is not a gentler delay, it is the old behaviour with extra machinery.
