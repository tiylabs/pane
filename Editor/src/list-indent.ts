/*
 * Tab and ⇧Tab inside a list.
 *
 * These were `indentWithTab` — CodeMirror's generic indent, which adds one `indentUnit` (two
 * spaces) to the line whatever the line happens to be. In markdown that is not an indent, it is a
 * guess, and it was right by coincidence for exactly one case:
 *
 *     - alpha        ⏎ ⇥ beta        - alpha
 *       - beta       →               ··- beta      ✓ a bullet's content starts at column 2
 *
 *     1. alpha       ⏎ ⇥ beta        1. alpha
 *       2. beta      →               ··2. beta     ✗ a number's content starts at column 3
 *
 * The second one is not a nested list. CommonMark needs a child indented to the **parent's content
 * column**, and two spaces under `1. ` falls short of three — so every markdown tool, pandoc
 * included, reads those two lines as one flat list with two items, and so does Plume. The keystroke
 * did nothing except add junk whitespace and confuse the renumbering filter, which then counted
 * straight through the levels: 1., 2., 3., 4. where the writer meant 1., 1., 2., 2.
 *
 * So indentation is computed from the list rather than from a constant. Tab moves an item to the
 * content column of the sibling above it; ⇧Tab moves it back to its parent's column. Both carry
 * everything nested underneath along with them, because an item and its children are one thing to
 * everyone except the buffer.
