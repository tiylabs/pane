/*
 * The ⌘K action panel — design frame 2a.
 *
 * Decision 17: everything that is not pin, switcher or new lives here, which is what lets the title
 * bar hold three icons forever. Built like the switcher and for the same reasons — inside the panel
 * (decision 14 wants every control in its own panel) rather than as a second window that would be a
 * second web view to keep warm.
 *
 * Frame 2a lists thirteen rows and this ships fourteen — all thirteen, plus Duplicate Note, which
 * Raycast carries on ⌘D and decision 39 took across with the rest of its key map.
 *
 * The thirteenth row came back. It was retired on the reasoning that decision 29 had already
 * answered it — a dragged height was a floor, so there was nothing left to switch off — and
 * decision 40 reversed decision 29 outright: a drag now turns auto-sizing OFF and the panel holds
 * that height, so the row is the way back on, on Raycast's own ⇧⌘/.
 *
 * Every row here is a thing Plume actually does, so none of them is a row that does nothing — the
 * same rule the Shortcuts tab follows (decision 31).
