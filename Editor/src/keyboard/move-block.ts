/*
 * ⌥↑ and ⌥↓, ⌃⌘↑ and ⌃⌘↓: move the block the caret is in — decision 174.
 *
 * CodeMirror's default binds ⌥↑ to "move line", which in a list moved the item and in prose pulled
 * one line into the paragraph break: two paragraphs merged and a blank line was left behind. The
 * unit here is the block, as in Typora: a list item with everything nested under it, among its
 * sibling items, or a paragraph, heading, quote, code block or list among its neighbours. The gap
 * between the two swaps with them untouched, and the caret moves with its block. At the first or
 * last sibling nothing happens. ⌃⌘↑ is the same key under the shortcut Raycast uses (39).
 *
 * ⇧⌥↑ and ⇧⌥↓ select to the block's start or end, as they do in macOS text; the default duplicated
 * the line. ⌘⌥↑ and ⌘⌥↓ added a second caret, which Plume does not keep, and parked the one it did
 * keep on the break; they now do nothing.
