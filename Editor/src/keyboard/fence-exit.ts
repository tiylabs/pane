/*
 * ↑ and ↓ out of a code block always arrive somewhere — decision 175.
 *
 * A fence line is not a place (151), so ↓ from a block's last line steps over the closing fence to
 * the next place. When the block ended the note there was none, and ↓ did nothing: only ⇧⏎ (147)
 * got out. When the block started the note, nothing got above it at all; and between two adjacent
 * blocks, ↓ went straight into the next one's code. Typora opens a line in each of those places.
 *
 * So does Plume now, in 147's shape — a blank line each side and the caret on an open line between.
 * ↓ and → at the end of a block's last line open one below it when the note ends there or another
 * block follows; ↑ and ← at the start of its first line open one above it when the note starts
 * there or another block precedes. Anywhere else these keys are what they were.
