/*
 * What is revealed — the source shown under the selection — decided once per rebuild.
 *
 * Seven decisions describe when a construct shows its markdown rather than its rendering: 44, 53,
 * 57, 77, 89, 132 and 139. They used to be spread through the decoration walk as conditions on
 * individual constructs, so a change to the rule had to be found in each of them. This is the one
 * place. `decorate.ts` reads the answer and never re-derives it.
 *
 * **Only inline constructs reveal (151).** A block's markers are drawn and never written out, so
 * nothing here keys off "the caret is on this line" any more; what survives of the caret is the
 * blank line it stands on. Where the caret may *stand* is a different question, and `caret.ts`
 * answers it.
 *
 * Pure over the state and two facts about the view — whether it has focus, and whether the caret
 * arrived by typing — which is what makes the rules testable in plain node (`tests/unit/`).

 *
 * **Nothing is revealed while the editor is not focused** (53). A panel you have clicked away from
 * is not where you are working, and a note left showing `**A research plan**` on one line reads as
 * a rendering bug rather than as a caret. Nothing is lost on the way back: focus returns, the line

 * (139).
 *
 * **Why a range and not simply the caret.** Revealing an inline construct changes the line's width —
 * `**bold**` is 26px wider shown than hidden, measured in 139 — so a caret-only rule would move the
 * text sideways the instant a drag *starting inside a bold run* became non-empty, under the pointer,
 * mid-gesture. And why only a *single-line* range: that same width, paid on every line at once, is

 * Decision 44 exempts the caret's blank line from the collapse so that pressing ⏎ in prose lands
 * the caret at full height and the first keystroke moves nothing. That argument is entirely about
 * *arriving by editing*. Applied to arriving by clicking or arrowing it buys nothing and costs the
 * thing it was written to prevent: click the blank line between two paragraphs and it grows 8px to
 * 20px under the pointer, so the note appears to gain a line you did not ask for. Reported exactly
 * that way, on the grounds that ⏎ and ⇧⏎ are how you ask for space.
 *
 * So the exemption keys off this instead. Set by any document change and cleared by a selection
 * change that is not one — never cleared by a rebuild for some other reason (a viewport scroll, a
 * tree finishing), because those do not move the caret and must not change what it is standing on.
 *
 * Module state rather than a StateField because it describes the *last update*, not the document,
