/*
 * Ordered lists that count.
 *
 * Plume draws the number the buffer holds rather than rendering one, so a list that says 1, 3, 4
 * after you delete an item says 1, 3, 4 forever — there is no renderer to quietly fix it, and
 * retyping the markers by hand is the only cure. Every editor anyone has used renumbers instead.
 *
 * **This shipped once and was pulled, and the reason is the whole design of this file.** The first
 * version was a transaction filter that appended corrections to any transaction touching a list.
 * Undo is such a transaction: the appended changes were computed against the document the history
 * was reconstructing, so positions valid for one document were applied to another. It went out
 * with a note saying it comes back once undo is in the editor matrix, which it now is.
 *
 * The rule that came out of that: **a filter that writes to the document has to say which
 * transactions it is *for*, not which it is against.** `isEdit` below is that list, and it is an
 * allow-list of user edits — everything else, including undo, redo, a note load and an external
 * reload, falls straight through untouched.
 *
 * Two more things it has to get right, both from decision 81:
 *
 *   - **A run keeps its first number when the author chose it.** `5. 6. 7.` stays at 5. Only the
 *     items *after* the first are ever made to follow.
 *   - **It restarts at 1 when it is only first because the item above it stopped being one.**
 *     Deleting `1. a` from `1. a / 2. b / 3. c` leaves a list starting at 2, which is not a choice
 *     anybody made. Telling those apart needs the document *before* the change, which is why the
 *     start number is decided by mapping back through `tr.changes` rather than by reading the new
 *     document harder.
 *
 * And it reads the tree, like every other command since decision 78 — not because the tree is
 * tidier but because `1. one` inside a fenced code block is a line of code, and a line scan that
 * renumbered it would be corrupting the one thing decision 5 protects.
