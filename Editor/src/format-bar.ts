 * The first two are why a blank line goes above and `needsSeparation` decides it — the same rule
 * that stops an empty marker written under a list item being swallowed by it. The third is why one

 * whitespace maps to before the marker — the one position that reads as the button having inserted
 * the marker somewhere else.
 *
 * The caret then lands immediately after a marker's trailing space on its own active line, which is
 * decision 122's fault to the character: a fixed-width marker box strands that space where WebKit
 * will not put a caret after it, and the next character typed goes in front of the marker. It is
 * safe here only because `rawListMark` takes a `min-width` rather than a width, for exactly that
