/*
 * Live preview: rendered markdown everywhere except the line the caret is on.
 *
 * This is the hardest thing in the product and the thing most likely to make it feel broken. The
 * brief is blunt about it — "reconciling raw source with rendered decorations is where these editors
 * break, usually as cursor instability. If it feels janky the entire premise is gone."
 *
 * The contract, from decision 5: the buffer IS the markdown. Everything here is a view-only
 * decoration. Nothing in this file may change a single byte of the document, which is what lets Plume
 * promise a byte-for-byte round trip.
 *
 * WHAT HAPPENS ON THE ACTIVE LINE. Inline constructs go fully raw — the markers reappear and the
 * inline styling drops, matching the one example the design draws ("the raw syntax stays visible on
 * the active line: **byte-for-byte**"). Block constructs — heading size, code block background,
 * blockquote bar — keep their styling and merely reveal their markers. That split is deliberate:
 * bold and italic do not change line height, so revealing them costs nothing, whereas dropping an
 * h1 to body size as the caret enters it would reflow the document under the user's hands. That is
 * exactly the instability the brief warns about.

 * - a `URL` inside an `Image` is **literal text**, not a link — Plume does not interpret images, so
 *   `![alt](url)` renders every character of itself and nothing there is clickable;
 * - everything else that got the accent — `[label](target)`, `<https://x>`, a bare `https://`,
 *   `www.` or address, and the target half of a `[ref]: target` definition — opens.
 *
 * A **reference** link (`[text][ref]`, or the shortcut `[ref]`) has no `URL` child at all: its
 * target is a `[ref]: target` line elsewhere in the note. The first draft declined those, and the
 * sweep in `commands.test.js` failed on exactly that — which was the right answer, because a
 * reference link is painted with the accent and a thing that looks like a link and does nothing is
